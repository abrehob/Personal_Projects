# Background
My friend Justin and I have been playing Super Smash Bros. Ultimate since the day of its release in December 2018.  Because we were so interested in the online doubles match environment, Justin has recorded data from all of our online matches.  We weren't able to make much sense of the data until 2022: I started taking an online class in Data Analytics in January, and analyzing the Smash data seemed like the ideal capstone for the course.

# Estimated Timeline
* Created: May 2022
* Last major update: July 2022
* Added to repository: July 2022

# Project Organization
* The Data Analytics course broke down the procedure of analytics into 6 phases, which influenced the organization of this project:
1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Process
4. Analyze
5. Visualize
6. (Act)
* The output of each phase is given within its respective folder.
* Many project files are directly stored within this repository.  However, most files are hosted by another online service such as Google Docs or Tableau Public; links to these webpages will be provided within a txt file.
* Before going any further, I suggest you check out the project summary at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zjPyctxvCIN1JtP0jWH8u7_RRlhvqGHsP2jW0C2JWLY/edit?usp=sharing
