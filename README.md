# Project Summaries

Below are quick descriptions of each of my personal projects.  More detail for each project is provided in the README file within its respective folder.

### SSBU Data Analysis
Effort level: 160 hours

This project utilizes spreadsheets, R, and SQL to analyze data related to the opponents we face when playing Super Smash Bros. Ultimate online.  I answer questions such as, "What are the most commonly picked characters?" and "What characters are the toughest to beat?"

### Change of Fate
Effort level: 40 hours

This is a Unity puzzle game I developed within a month for my Video Game Design class at the University of Michigan.  The goal of the game is to drag-and-drop tiles to guide a moving ball to the goal.

### Smash 4 Player Rankings
Effort level: 10 hours

This Python project optimally assigns players to teams according to skill level for Super Smash Bros. for Wii U.  Player scores are calculated based upon match results, and the player assignment that minimizes team score difference is selected for the next match.

### Catan Fair Dice
Effort level: 5 hours

This C++ project serves as an alternative method to rolling dice in the board game "Catan".  For less variance, numbers are placed into a virtual bag and selected randomly without replacement.
