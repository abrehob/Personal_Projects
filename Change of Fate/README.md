# Background
In 2017, I took a Video Game Design class at the University of Michigan.  While students formed teams for a majority of the projects, we were required to work individually for one of the projects.  We had a month to develop a simple game of our own design.  The files in this folder are associated with the game I personally developed, called "Change of Fate".

# Estimated Timeline
* Created: February 2017
* Last major update: March 2017
* Added to repository: April 2022

# Things to Keep in Mind
* This project was developed with an old version of Unity.  After updating it to use a newer version, Unity informed me that my project structure and/or scripts may have been altered.  This didn't seem to cause any problems when I tested it in April 2022, but don't be surprised if it doesn't work without a bit of tweaking.
* We had only a month to develop a game, so set your expectations accordingly.

# Instructions
1. Install Unity version 2020.3.32f1
2. Open this folder in Unity
3. Build and run the game
